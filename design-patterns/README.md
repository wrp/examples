A brief summary of the 23 design patterns from GoF (ISBN: 0-201-63361-2)

# Creational:
- Singleton         Restrict initialization of a class to ensure at most one instance is created.
- Factory           Move responsibility of instantiation from the class to the Factory class.
- Abstract Factory  The AbstractFactory class is used to generate Factory classes.
- Builder           The Builder class encapsulates complex initialization logic.
- Prototype         Create new objects by cloning (and modifying) the prototype.

# Structural:
- Adapter           Adapter class provides an interface between two unrelated entities.
- Bridge            Decouple the interface from the implementation.
- Composite         Treat a group of related objects as a single object.
- Decorator         Modify behavior at run-time.
- Facade            Implement wrapper to reduce complexity.
- Flyweight         Cache and reuse immutable objects.
- Proxy             Access objects via a surrogate.

# Behavioral
- Template          Create method stub and defer implmentation to subclasses.
- Mediator          Provide centralized communication between objects.
- Chain of Responsibility  Request from client is pushed to chain of objects.
- Observer          The Observer class watches the Subject.
- Strategy          Implementation is selected at runtime.
- Command           Command object encapulates everything needed to trigger an action.
- State             An object's behavior is based on internal state.
- Visitor           Represent an operation to be performed on common elements.
- Interpreter       Create your own language!!
- Iterator          Provides method for iteration.
- Memento           Enable transactions/roll-back by saving state.
