# You can use bq to disply the config of a dataset:
bq show --format=prettyjson ${PROJECT?}:$dataset

# And that same information can also be obtained via curl
curl \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-X GET \
	https://bigquery.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/${PROJECT:?}/datasets/$dataset

# Note that I was unable to successfully update the defaultEncryptionConfiguration using
# bq update, but that it worked with the same json using curl -X PATCH.
# Not sure if that is a bq bug, and don't care to find out.
