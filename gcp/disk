To create a disk image:

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images

Mount the disk on a vm and get it to the state you want.  The docs claim you can
create the image while it's attached, but that appears to be untrue (as of
Google Cloud SDK 226.0.0, bq 2.0.38, core 2018.11.16, gsutil 4.34), as I'm
getting the error:

 - The disk resource '..<disk name>..' is already being used by '..<instance name>..''

 So stop the vm, then run:

 gcloud compute images create ${image_name?} \
	--source-disk ${ref_to_disk?} \
	--source-disk-zone ${zone-us-central1-b} \
	${family+--family ${family}}

image_name is the name you are giving to the new disk
ref_to_disk can be found from the description of the vm. eg:
      'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/.../zones/us-central1-b/disks/...'



********************************************
To create, attach, mount a new disk to a vm:

gcloud compute disks create ${disk_name?} \
	--description "${description?}" \
	--zone=${zone?} \
	--size=${size-200G}
gcloud compute instances attach-disk ${instance?} \
	--disk=${disk_name?}

Now, describe the instance to figure out which disk it is (probably a better way
to do this TODO, find the better way):

gcloud compute instances describe --format=json ${instance?}

on the instance, run 'lsblk' to confirm the tables before creating a filesystem:
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/${device?}

Then mount the device
sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/${device?} ${mount_path?}
