Some random thoughts.

The language designers misspelled "while".  Instead of using 'for' as the
looping keyword, they should have dumped it and kept 'while'.

gofmt is stupid.  The whole notion of having the language dictate style
issues is brain dead.  I can appreciate the idea that it may improve tooling,
but it is horribly misguided.  For example, I just ran go fmt on the
code tree here and part of the generated diff is:

@@ -29,7 +28,7 @@ func closure(){
                        r = n
                } else {
                        p := fib(n - 2)
-                       r = fib(n - 1) + p
+                       r = fib(n-1) + p
                }
                return


There is no excuse for removing the whitespace around the -, and
the inconsistency here with it failing to modify the whitespace
in the := line is .... inconsistent.


log.Println prints to stderr by default.  This is fucking stupid.

"func" is a mistake.  They should have been verbose and used the keyword "function"

The stated justification for not including a ternary operator is just lame.
Any language construct can be abused.  If you want to avoid ?: because it
makes the parser more complex, that's fine.  Use that justification.
Any other reason is just dumb.


Not to sound too negative; overall I like the language, but the culture
has some issues.  The designers want to treat developers like idiots
and hold their hand.  Maybe that's justified, but it's a bit insulting.
