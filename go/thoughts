Some random thoughts.

The language designers misspelled "while".  Instead of using 'for' as the
looping keyword, they should have dumped it and kept 'while'.

gofmt is stupid.  The whole notion of having the language dictate style
issues is brain dead.  I can appreciate the idea that it may improve tooling,
but it is horribly misguided.  For example, I just ran go fmt on the
code tree here and part of the generated diff is:

@@ -29,7 +28,7 @@ func closure(){
                        r = n
                } else {
                        p := fib(n - 2)
-                       r = fib(n - 1) + p
+                       r = fib(n-1) + p
                }
                return


There is no excuse for removing the whitespace around the -, and
the inconsistency here with it failing to modify the whitespace
in the := line is .... inconsistent.
