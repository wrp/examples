make image  # create the zig-playground
make run    # start a shell in the container

In the container, this directory should be mounted
at /$USER (check the common-makefile in ../docker)


zig basics:
to build a single executable:
	zig build-exe ${name}.zig

to build a project:
	# see https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/
	zig build --summary all # requires build.zig

to bootstrap (create boilerplate build.zig):
	zig init

to run:
	zig run ${name}.zig -- arguments

to test:
	zig test ${name}.zig
