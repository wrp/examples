First impressions while I explore the language.

errdefer seems like a great idea.

making function parameters immutable and allowing the compiler to decide
whether or not to pass by reference or value is an interesting choice.  I
believe the author of the code can force pass by reference by explicitly
passing a pointer, but this seems like discarding clarity for potential
performance.  I like the idea of immutable arguments, but am less certain
I like the uncertainty of letting the compiler make a choice.

camelCase is stupid.  Every language recently says "emphasize readability
over writeability".  camelCase is not readable, and exists only to assist
in wrtieability and shaving a few characters off for width purposes. It
has no place in a modern language.
