- newline: >
        this is a single string
        which retains spaces at end of
        line but discards the newline
           and indentation that matches the first line
        (eg, there will be a total of 3 spaces and
        a newline before "and", and a single newline before '(')
  defintion: >
        Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a
        literal style (indicated by “|”) where all line breaks are
        significant.  Alternatively, they can be written with the
        folded style (denoted by “>”) where each line break is
        folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented
        line.
