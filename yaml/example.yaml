        this is a single string
        which compresses newline and following
           indentation that matches the first line to one space
        (eg, there will be one space between "string" and "which" and
        there will be a total of 3 spaces and
        a newline before "and", and a single newline before '(')

        Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a
        literal style (indicated by "|") where all line breaks are
        significant.  Alternatively, they can be written with the
        folded style (denoted by ">") where each line break is
        folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented
        line.
