        | is the "literal style"
        If there is a second character (eg >- or |-), that
        character is the "block chomping indicator".
        Without a block chomping indicator, the default is "clip"
        which puts a single newline at the end of the string.
        a '-' is the "strip chomping indicator" which removes all
        newlines. To keep all newlines, use '+'
        this is a single string
        which compresses newline and following
           indentation that matches the first line to one space
        (eg, there will be one space between "string" and "which" and
        there will be a total of 3 spaces and
        a newline before "and", and a single newline before '(')
  defintion: >
        Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a
        literal style (indicated by "|") where all line breaks are
        significant.  Alternatively, they can be written with the
        folded style (denoted by ">") where each line break is
        folded to a space unless it ends an empty or a more-indented
        line.
