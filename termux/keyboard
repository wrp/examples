Touch Keyboard
Use of keys like Alt, Ctrl, Esc is necessary for working with a CLI terminal. Termux touch keyboards do not include one. For that purpose Termux uses the Volume down button to emulate the Ctrl key. For example, pressing}Volume down+L on a touch keyboard sends the same input as pressing Ctrl+L on a hardware keyboard.

The result of using Ctrl in combination with a key depends on which program is used, but for many command line tools the following shortcuts works:

Ctrl+A → Move cursor to the beginning of line
Ctrl+C → Abort (send SIGINT to) current process
Ctrl+D → Logout of a terminal session
Ctrl+E → Move cursor to the end of line
Ctrl+K → Delete from cursor to the end of line
Ctrl+L → Clear the terminal
Ctrl+Z → Suspend (send SIGTSTP to) current process
Ctrl+alt+C → Open new session (only work in Hacker's Keyboard)
The Volume up key also serves as a special key to produce certain input:

Volume Up+E → Escape key
Volume Up+T → Tab key
Volume Up+1 → F1 (and Volume Up+2 → F2, etc)
Volume Up+0 → F10
Volume Up+B → Alt+B, back a word when using readline
Volume Up+F → Alt+F, forward a word when using readline
Volume Up+X → Alt+X
Volume Up+W → Up arrow key
Volume Up+A → Left arrow key
Volume Up+S → Down arrow key
Volume Up+D → Right arrow key
Volume Up+L → | (the pipe character)
Volume Up+H → ~ (the tilde character)
Volume Up+U → _ (underscore)
Volume Up+P → Page Up
Volume Up+N → Page Down
Volume Up+. → Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT)
Volume Up+V → Show the volume control
Volume Up+Q → Show extra keys view
Volume Up+K → Another variant to toggle extra keys view
Extra Keys Row(s)
Termux also has an extra keys view which allows you to extend your current keyboard. To enable the extra keys view you have to long tap on the keyboard button in the left drawer menu. You can also press Volume Up+Q or Volume Up+K.

After Termux v0.66 extra keys row became configurable through file "~/.termux/termux.properties". If this file does not exist, you will need to create it.

Example configuration to enable 2-row (was in v0.65) extra keys:

extra-keys = [['ESC','/','-','HOME','UP','END','PGUP'],['TAB','CTRL','ALT','LEFT','DOWN','RIGHT','PGDN']]
The extra-keys definition itself can also be spread over multiple lines, if desired, by "backslash-escaping" the line feed at the end of each line, thus:

extra-keys = [ \
 ['ESC','|','/','HOME','UP','END','PGUP','DEL'], \
  ['TAB','CTRL','ALT','LEFT','DOWN','RIGHT','PGDN','BKSP'] \
  ]
  Each key "entry" can be either a string (such as '|', '/' or '=') or one of the values listed below. These values are defined in ExtraKeysView.java, and the list of values (not including possible synonyms) is:

  CTRL ("special key")
  ALT ("special key")
  FN ("special key")
  ESC ("special key")
  TAB
  HOME
  END
  PGUP
  PGDN
  INS
  DEL
  BKSP
  UP
  LEFT
  RIGHT
  DOWN
  ENTER
  BACKSLASH
  QUOTE
  APOSTROPHE
