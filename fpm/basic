fpm seems somewhat clumsy, but maybe I just need more experience with it.
If you have done:

$ make DESTDIR=$dest install

you can create a usable .deb with:

fpm -n ${package_name} -s dir -t deb -C ${dest}


it seems a bit odd, in that when printing the file list in the resulting package
with dpkg -c, each path is prefixed with './', but the package seems to work.
