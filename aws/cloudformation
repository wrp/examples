NAME
       cloudformation -

DESCRIPTION
       CloudFormation  allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services in-
       frastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use Cloud-
       Formation  to  leverage  Amazon  Web  Services products, such as Amazon
       Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple  Noti-
       fication  Service,  Elastic  Load  Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build
       highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective  applications  without
       creating  or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastruc-
       ture.

       With CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies
       in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a
       single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all mem-
       ber  resources  of  the  stack  together  and  manages all dependencies
       between the resources for you.

       For more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation Prod-
       uct Page .

       CloudFormation  makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you
       need additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices  product, you can find the product's technical documentation at `
       docs.aws.amazon.com https://docs.aws.amazon.com/
