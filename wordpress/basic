Steps taken as I start using wordpress on cloudways.

First, create a server and an application.  This gives you
a node in a cloud provider and a skeleton directory structure.
You will have limited write access to the applications/ directory
(which is good), but for some reason you don't have write
access to .bashrc (which seems really stupid, given that the
stock .bashrc is completely lame).  But it seems to mostly work.


Create a wp-admin user:

wp user create wrp ${EMAIL} --role=administrator

In my case, simply using my email address generated an error
that the email address was being duplicated, likely because
it is the email being used by the generic account since it
is the email I used to create the cloudways accoung.  Get
around that by using a variant.  (eg, append "+wp" to the
username in the email address.

This generates a random password.  Seems reasonable to use
that password.

Once you have an admin user, you can navigate to $site/wp-admin
and login.  Now use the ui to configure the site.  Note
that the cloudways chatbot refers to the 'wp' tool as 'WP-CLI'.
In other words, whenever some chump talks about "WP-CLI" or
"wp-cli", they are talking about a tool named "wp".  Next time
I want to list the names in a directory, I'm going to use
the "LS-CLI"!!  I hate the trends in this industry.


Install elementor and wp-forms plugins via the wp-admin/ page
Also install the Astra theme


To clear the cache:

wp cache flush

This clears all WordPress cache types (site, edge, CDN, object cache).
For Breeze plugin users:

wp breeze purge --cache=all

This purges both the plugin's internal cache and Varnish cache.

For Magento applications:
php bin/magento cache:clean
php bin/magento cache:flush

# Allegedly (according to chat GPT, but I have not verified yet),
# this will get me some good json:
wp post get ${POST_ID} --field=post_content --format=json


# To get the fully rendered html (again, according to Chat GPT, not
# yet verified):
curl -s "$(wp post get ${POST_ID} --field=guid)" > page.html

You can find the POST_ID with:
wp post list --post_type=page --fields=ID,post_title,post_name



To change title font sizes of suppress completly in subpages,
edit custom css under Appearance -> Customize -> Additional CSS
