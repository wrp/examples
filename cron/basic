Excerpt from crontab(5) (cronie 1.5.2):

       A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for
       "first-last".

       Ranges  of  numbers  are  allowed.   Ranges are two numbers
       separated with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.
       For example, 8-11 for an 'hours' entry specifies execution at
       hours 8, 9, 10, and 11. The  first number must be less than or
       equal to the second one.

       Randomization of the execution time within a range can be used.
       A random number within a range specified as two numbers separated
       with a tilde is picked.  The specified range is inclusive.
       For example,  6~15  for  a 'minutes'  entry  picks a random minute
       within 6 to 15 range.  The random number is picked when crontab
       file is parsed.  The first number must be less than or equal
       to the second one. You might omit one or both of the numbers
       specifying  the  range.   For example, ~ for a 'minutes' entry
       picks a random minute within 0 to 59 range.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers  (or  ranges)
       separated  by  commas.   Examples:  "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".

       Step  values  can be used in conjunction with ranges.
       Following a range with "/<number>" specifies skips of the
       number's value through the range.  For example, "0-23/2" can
       be used in the  'hours'  field  to  specify command  execution
       for every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
       "0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20, 22").  Step values are also permitted
       after an asterisk, so if specifying a job to be run every  two
       hours, you can use "*/2".

       Names can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.
       Use the first three letters of the particular day or month (case
       does not matter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

       These special time specification "nicknames" which replace the
       5 initial time and date fields, and are  pre‚Äê fixed with the
       '@' character, are supported:

       @reboot    :    Run once after reboot.
       @yearly    :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @annually  :    Run once a year, ie.  "0 0 1 1 *".
       @monthly   :    Run once a month, ie. "0 0 1 * *".
       @weekly    :    Run once a week, ie.  "0 0 * * 0".
       @daily     :    Run once a day, ie.   "0 0 * * *".
       @hourly    :    Run once an hour, ie. "0 * * * *".
