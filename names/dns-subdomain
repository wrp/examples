This is taken from documentation at kubernetes.io.
After a quick perusalo RFC 1123, I do not see this
description there and am not sure if the k8s docs
just have the rfc wrong.  Not worth tracking down
right now.


RFC 1123 rules for a valid dns subdomain name:

No more than 253 characters in length.
Valid characters are [-a-z.] (lowercase, hyphen, and period)
Must start and end with alpha.


But RFC 1035 says:

	<domain> ::= <subdomain> | " "
	<subdomain> ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>
	<label> ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]
	<ldh-str> ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>
	<let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"
	<let-dig> ::= <letter> | <digit>
	<letter> ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in
	upper case and a through z in lower case
	<digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9

	Note that while upper and lower case letters are allowed in domain
	names, no significance is attached to the case.  That is, two names with
	the same spelling but different case are to be treated as if identical.

Which suggests a subdomain can be uppercase, but since it does not matter
k8s has decided to disallow uppercase.
