This is taken from documentation at kubernetes.io.
After a quick perusalo RFC 1123, I do not see this
description there and am not sure if the k8s docs
just have the rfc wrong.  Not worth tracking down
right now.


RFC 1123 rules for a valid dns subdomain name:

No more than 253 characters in length.
Valid characters are [-a-z.] (lowercase, hyphen, and period)
Must start and end with alpha.
