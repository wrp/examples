# Find all regular files and ignore those in .git
find . -name .git -prune -o -type f -print | less

# The explicit -print is necessary to avoid printing .git
#
# When no action is specified, find applies an implicit -print to the entire expression, and
# the command effectively becomes: find . \( -name .git -prune -o -type f \) -print
#
# Since -prune returns true, .git matches the overall expression and gets printed.


# Arghh! in -exec, + must immediately follow {}.  Otherwise, it does
# not terminate the command
