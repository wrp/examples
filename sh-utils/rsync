# Copy files in foo to bar, deleting unmatched files in bar
$ rsync -zva --delete foo/ bar

# Copy the directory foo into bar (will copy to bar/foo/*)
$ rsync -zva --delete foo bar

# Copy files in foo to bar, deleting unmatched files in bar
# but keeping bar/file-to-keep  (P == protect)
$ rsync -zva --delete --filter 'P file-to-keep' foo/ bar

# -a is the same as -rlptgoD
#    -r  recurse
#    -l  copy symlinks as symlinks
#    -p  preserve permissions
#    -t  preserve timestamps
#    -g  preserve group
#    -o  preserve owner
#    -D  preserve device files


# Perhaps a more useful set of options is -rlpgoH
#  which won't try to change timestamps and preserves hard links
