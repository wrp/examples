Very ignorant README.  Trust nothing.  This is based on me digging
through my .bash-history from many months ago while sitting on a couch
with no internet access and no Rust documentation.

To start a new project:
cargo new $project

This creates:
${project}/Cargo.toml
${project}/src/main.rs
apparently using user information from git. (Cargo.toml gets email
and author name, and seems to get it from the git config).

From inside ${project}/ , run "cargo run"
