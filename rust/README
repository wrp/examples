Very ignorant README.  Trust nothing.  This is based on me digging
through my .bash-history from many months ago while sitting on a couch
with no internet access and no Rust documentation.

To start a new project:
cargo new $project

This creates:
${project}/Cargo.toml
${project}/src/main.rs
apparently using user information from git. (Cargo.toml gets email
and author name, and seems to get it from the git config).

From inside ${project}, run "cargo run"

=========
The above is fairly high level.  Just do:

$ rustc $file.rs  # Compile and create executable $file

Read local docs with
$ rustup doc


Notes on the language as I go through initially.

* Allowing the naming convention of a variable to suppress unused variable
  compiler warnings is weird.  It seems that ought to be reserved for an explicit directive.
  This seems like a convenience that has no real purpose.

* Labelled break/continue! Awesome.  Single quote in the label notation: ick

* #[warn(non_camel_case_types)] on by default is utterly stupid.  The language
  should not dictate such style choices.  Especially horrible ones.
