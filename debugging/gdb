To work with a running process:
$ gdb -p $pid $exe

To work with a core dump:
$ gdb $exe $core_file
gdb> bt        # Show backtrace
gdb> frame 2   # Go to frame 2 in the backtrace

To generate a core dump, probably just need to:
ulimit -c unlimited


To display data at each breakpoint, use 'display'
or 'commands'

set follow-fork-mode child
set follow-fork-mode parent
