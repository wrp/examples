@# A stub Makefile used to bootstrap.
# The expectation is that when no Makefile exists,
# make will invoke co to generate a Makefile from Makefile,v
# and then use that Makefile to generate a configure script
# which will be executed.  When the configure script is
# executed, it should overwrite the Makefile.  That is,
# this file should only exist for a short time until it is
# overwritten.  If you are reading this message, something
# has gone slightly wrong.  You will need to run autoreconf
# to generate a configure script, then run the configure script
# to generate a Makefile, and then invoke make to build the project.
# There is ample documentation of this process available online.
