@A stub Makefile to bootstrap the project.  If the user has RCS installed,
an invocation of 'make' in the top-level directory will cause a Makefile
to be generated from this file (this may be a gnu-make feature) which
will create a sub-directory in which the project will be built.
Common targets are provided which will be executed in the builddir.
The default subdir is debug/, but can be overriden by assigning
BUILDDIR.
