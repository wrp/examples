In calc:

Need to be able to manipulate the stack and memory better.
Also, need to be able to clear things out.  Perhaps something
like [1,4,6,9]m to push items 1,4,6,9 from the memory to the
stack.   I like the idea of keeping items fixed in memory (so
item N is constant), but if we avoid duplication that means
that important values may wind up being inaccessible.  eg, if
you compute a value that is important and then compute a lot
of unimportant values, the important one will scroll off the
top of the display when you list the memory content.

Add the ability to evaluate a polynomial. Eg, something
like "[4x^3 + 2x - 12y][eval 3x 8y] where 3x would cause
x to take the value from memory location 3 and y from 8 (or more likely
off the stack)

Add a memory.  User should have access to all values previously used.
See comment in 709e6c6f

Categorize values.  eg, in the display of the memory, it would
be nice to know if a value was entered, or calculated.  if
calculated, by what operator/function?  Also, we could indicate
if a value is already in memory and avoid duplicates.

Make it possible to specify a base for integer inputs.

Either have all of the registers pre-loaded with all the known
functions, or have ! cause them to be loaded if they are empty, or
have a command line argument to preload them.

Maybe make ! compute a factorial, and use a different operator for
running a function.  Or add a "fac" function.

Perhaps validate commas.  ie, "1,000" is a valid number, but "1,23"
is not.  Not sure how to handle values to the right of the radix
point.
