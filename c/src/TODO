In calc:
Add a memory.  User should have access to all values previously used.
See comment in 709e6c6f

Make it possible to specify a base for integer inputs.

Either have all of the registers pre-loaded with all the known
functions, or have ! cause them to be loaded if they are empty, or
have a command line argument to preload them.

Maybe make ! compute a factorial, and use a different operator for
running a function.  Or add a "fac" function.

Perhaps validate commas.  ie, "1,000" is a valid number, but "1,23"
is not.  Not sure how to handle values to the right of the radix
point.
