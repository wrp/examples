Sequence Replacement
======== ===========
  ??=         #
  ??(         [
  ??/         \
  ??)         ]
  ??'         ^
  ??<         {
  ??!         |
  ??>         }
  ??-         ~
The effect of this is that statements such as

printf ("Eh???/n");
will, after the trigraph is replaced, be the equivalent of

printf ("Eh?\n");
Should the programmer want the trigraph not to be replaced, within
strings and character constants (which is the only place they would
need replacing and it would change things), the programmer can
simply escape the second question mark; e.g.

 printf ("Two question marks in a row: ?\?!\n");


The 1999 C standard added these punctuators, sometimes called
digraphs, in section 6.4.6. They are equivalent to the following
tokens except for their spelling:
