# First, check in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions to see if a completion
# already exists.  If so, source the file there.

# Basically, to make a completion, you need to tie a function to a command.  That
# function needs to populate COMPREPLY.  For example:

_example_completion() {
	list='these are the possible completions'
	COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "$list" -- "${COMP_WORDS[$COMP_CWORD]}"))
}

complete -o default -F _example_completion example

# If you source this file, then 'example t<tab>' should generate
# "these" and "the" as possible completions
