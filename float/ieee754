Just for curiosity's sake,

  At 2⁴⁶, the ulp is 2⁻⁶ = 0.015625. The doubles are spaced at:
  2⁴⁶ + 0.000000
  2⁴⁶ + 0.015625  → rounds to .02
  2⁴⁶ + 0.031250  → rounds to .03
  2⁴⁶ + 0.046875  → rounds to .05
  ...

  For $70,368,744,177,664.01:
  - Nearest double below: 2⁴⁶ (distance 0.01)
  - Nearest double above: 2⁴⁶ + 0.015625 (distance 0.005625)
  - Closest double is 2⁴⁶ + 0.015625, which rounds to .02, not .01

  So the smallest dollar value that cannot be represented in a double is:
  $70,368,744,177,664.01

For single precision (32-bit float):

  - 23 mantissa bits, so ulp = 2^(e-23)
  - ulp exceeds 0.01 when e ≥ 17
  - At 2¹⁷ = 131,072, ulp = 2⁻⁶ = 0.015625

  For $131,072.01:
  - Nearest float below: 131,072 (distance 0.01)
  - Nearest float above: 131,072.015625 (distance 0.005625)
  - Rounds to .02

  Answer: $131,072.01

  So single precision loses cent accuracy at just $131K - which is why single precision should never be used for financial calculations.
