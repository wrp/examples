The file should probably just be called TODO.  I expect
it to be a hodge-podge of "stuff I learned about but haven't
yet had a chance to explore" and realistically I expect to
never remove anything from here even after I have learned
it.  Mostly creating this file because I just discovered
that instead of modifying /etc/apt/sources.list or files
in /etc/apt/source.list.d, repostiories can be added using
add-apt-repository.  I don't know if this is recommended,
or if this a useful tool, or if it is already obsolete, so
I need to do some research.  But I don't have time right now.
