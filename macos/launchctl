SYNOPSIS launchctl subcommand [arguments ...]

DESCRIPTION
     launchctl interfaces with launchd to manage and inspect daemons, agents and XPC services.

SUBCOMMANDS
     system/[service-name]
     user/<uid>/[service-name]
     login/<asid>/[service-name]
     gui/<uid>/[service-name]
     pid/<pid>/[service-name]

SUBCOMMANDS
     bootstrap | bootout domain-target [service-path service-path2 ...] |
     enable | disable service-target
     kickstart [-kp] service-target
     attach [-ksx] service-target
     debug service-target [--program <program path>] [--guard-malloc]
     kill signal-name | signal-number service-target
     blame service-target
     print domain-target | service-target
     print-cache
     print-disabled domain-target
     plist [segment,section] Mach-O
     procinfo pid
     hostinfo
     resolveport owner-pid port-name
     examine [tool arg0 arg1 @PID ...]
     config system | user parameter value
     reboot [system|userspace|halt|logout|apps]
     error [posix|mach|bootstrap] code
     variant  Prints the launchd variant currently active on the system.
     version  Prints the launchd version string.

LEGACY SUBCOMMANDS
     load | unload [-wF] [-S sessiontype] [-D searchpath] paths ...

              NOTE: Due to bugs in the previous implementation and long-
              standing client expectations around those bugs, the load and
              unload subcommands will only return a non-zero exit code due to
              improper usage.  Otherwise, zero is always returned.

     submit -l label [-p executable] [-o stdout-path] [-e stderr-path] --
     remove label
     start label
     stop label
     list [-x] [label] Recommended alternative subcommand: print
     setenv key value
     unsetenv key
     getenv key
     export   Export all of the environment variables of launchd for use in a shell eval statement.
     getrusage self | children
     limit [cpu | filesize | data | stack | core | rss | memlock | maxproc |
     shutdown
              Tell launchd to prepare for shutdown by removing all jobs. This
              subcommand is not implemented.
     umask [newmask]
     bslist [PID | ..] [-j]
              This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.
     bsexec PID command [args]
     asuser UID command [args]
     bstree   This subcommand is not implemented and has been superseded by
              the print subcommand, which provides much richer information.

     managerpid
     manageruid
     managername
     help     Print out a quick usage statement.

CAVEATS
     The output produced by the "legacy" subcommands (chiefly list) should
     match their output on previous OS X releases. However, the output of
     newer subcommands does not conform to any particular format and is not
     guaranteed to remain stable across releases. These commands are intended
     for use by human developers and system administrators, not for automation
     by programs or scripts. Their output does not constitute an API and no
     promises of forward compatibility are offered to programs that attempt to
     parse it.

DEPRECATED AND REMOVED FUNCTIONALITY
     launchctl no longer has an interactive mode, nor does it accept commands
     from stdin. The /etc/launchd.conf file is no longer consulted for
     subcommands to run during early boot time; this functionality was removed
     for security considerations. While it was documented that
     $HOME/.launchd.conf would be consulted prior to setting up a user's
     session, this functionality was never implemented.

     launchd no longer uses Unix domain sockets for communication, so the
     LAUNCHD_SOCKET environment variable is no longer relevant and is not set.

     launchd no longer loads configuration files from the network

FILES
     ~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user.
     /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the
                                    administrator.
     /Library/LaunchDaemons         System wide daemons provided by the
                                    administrator.
     /System/Library/LaunchAgents   OS X Per-user agents.
     /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  OS X System wide daemons.
