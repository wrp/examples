So many versions of readline, and so many environments that ignore .editrc and .inputrc :(

This is a quick reminder of keys that work in google's cloudsql client.  (on my current Mac)

<esc>  b  - move back to start of word
<esc>  f  - move forward to one past end of next word
<ctrl> a  - move to beginning of line
<ctrl> b  - move backward one char
<ctrl> e  - move to end of line
<ctrl> f  - move forward one char
<ctrl> t  - transpose letters
