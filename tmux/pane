Copy a pane:
    capture-pane [-aepPqCJ] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S
    start-line] [-t target-pane]
		  (alias: capturep)
	    Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the
	    output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified
	    with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If -a is given,
	    the alternate screen is used, and the history is not
	    accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error
	    will be returned unless -q is given.  If -e is given,
	    the output includes escape sequences for text and
	    background attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable
	    char- acters as octal \xxx.  -J joins wrapped lines and
	    preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  -P
	    captures only any output that the pane has received
	    that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape
	    sequence.

	    -S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers,
	    zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative
	    numbers are lines in the history.  `-' to -S is the
	    start of the history and to -E the end of the visi- ble
	    pane.  The default is to capture only the visible
	    contents of the pane.
tmux capture-pane -p -S -10000 -t :0

# misc. cmds
:setw synchronize-panes    # Send keystrokes to multiple panes


To move window:
:movew -a -t {target-window}
# target-windows is of the form name-of-session:n  eg :movew -t 0:3
# without -a, the move will fail if the target window already exists.  With -a
# it pickes the next available index.


To move a pane between sessions, go to the destination pane:
:join-pane -s {src-pane}
src-pane is [{session}:]{window}[.{pane}]
eg:
:join-pane -s 2      # Split current window and insert pane with focus from window 2
:join-pane -s 2.1    # Split current window and insert pane witn index 1 from window 2
:join-pane -s name-of-session:2.1  # Split current window and insert pane witn index 1 from window 2 of session 4



Create a new pane above the current pane, using 80% of the screen:
tmux split-window -p 80 -b cmd with args
