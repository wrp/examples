When the shell stops responding, you've probably hit ctrl-S. Recover with ctrl-Q


# Copy a pane:
#     capture-pane [-aepPqCJ] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
#                   (alias: capturep)
#             Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If -a is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not
#             accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless -q is given.  If -e is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable char-
#             acters as octal \xxx.  -J joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  -P captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.
#
#             -S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  `-' to -S is the start of the history and to -E the end of the visi-
#             ble pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.
