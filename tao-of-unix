A simple list of simple best practices.

*) Fail loudly (but tersely), succeed quietly
   -) When an error occurs, a process should write a simple, concise, accurate
      error message to stderr and terminate.
*) Don't use logs as metrics
*) A usage statement is not an error message
*) Write errors to stderr.  Write output to stdout.  Write logs somewhere else.
