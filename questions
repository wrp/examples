General questions to which answers are needed.

vim:
	If you start vim with arguments '+/foo path', the cursor
	will be on the first instance of 'foo' in the buffer.
	If you then type '/pat' to search for pat in the buffer,
	all such instances of 'pat' are loaded into a history and
	you can scroll through with the arrow keys.  But 'foo'
	is not in that history.  How do you startup vim and
	put 'foo' in the history? (You get the same behavior
	with 'vim -c /foo')


	If the cursor is on a word and you type [n]*, you
	search forward for the nth next occurrence of the
	string.  But n cannot be zero.  How can you easily
	load the search buffer with the current word without
	moving the cursor?
