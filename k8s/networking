General rules:
	* every pod gets its own IP address and network namespace
	* No NAT: pods on a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes without NAT
	* agents on a node can communicate with all pods on the node
	* containers within a pod share the same network namespace, so can communicate over loopback

Every node gets a dedicated cidr range to give to pods
