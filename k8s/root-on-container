# To get root in a container:

# First get the node on which the container is running:

$ kubectl get pods -o wide
# The POD name is in column 1, node in column 7

# Then get the docker container id:
$ kubectl describe pod ${POD?} | egrep -B 1 'Container ID:'

# Ssh to the host and get into the container
$ ssh ${NODE}
$ docker exec -ti -u root $ID /bin/bash

(ID is the output of kubectl describe with "docker://" removed)
