	secrets and config mgmnt


from kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview:
k8s is "not a mere orchestration system". "It eliminates the need for orchestration"
Orchestration being defined as "execution of a defined workflow:  first do
A, then B, then C." "In contrast, Kubernetes comprises a set of independent,
composable control processes that continuously drive the current state
towards the provided desired state. It shouldn't matter how you get from
A to C. Centralized control is also not required. This results in a system
that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible."
