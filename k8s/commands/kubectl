kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.

# PODS
kubectl cp pod:/p/a/t/h /p/a/t/h                    # Copy a file from a pod to local
kubectl get pods ${selector+-l ${selector}}         # list pods
kubectl get pods -o json ${selector+-l ${selector}} # list pods in json format

# list all the containers in a pod  https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/
kubectl get pod ${pod?} -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].name}' ; echo

# Show the images used for each container in a pod   # https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/
kubectl get pods -o go-template --template='{{range .spec.containers}}{{.image}} {{end}}' ${pod?}; echo

# Manipulate a deployment
kubectl scale deployment ${deployment?} --replicas=${n-3} # Set the number of pods
kubectl rollout restart deployment ${deployment}  # Rolling restart
kubectl rollout status deployment ${deployment}   # Show status of rollout

# CONFIGS  k8s configs reside in $HOME/.kube
kubectl config current-context # Get the current context
kubectl config view            # See the available contexts

# namespaces
kubectl get namespaces
kubectl get pods --namespace "${namespace}"
kubectl get pods -A  # get pods from all namespaces

# Misc handy functions
# List all pods in all clusters
pods () {
	local cluster location
        gcloud container clusters list | awk 'NR > 1{print $1, $2}' | while read cluster location; do
                gcloud container clusters get-credentials $cluster --region $location;
                kubectl get pods > ${cluster}-pods;
        done
}
