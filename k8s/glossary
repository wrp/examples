daemon-set: a collection of pods which are assigned to every node of the cluster

workload:          an application running in k8s
workload resource: an object that manages a workload

statefulSet:

node: A worker machine in Kubernetes, part of a cluster.
cluster: A set of Nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
edge router: A router that enforces the firewall policy for your cluster. This could be a gateway managed by a cloud provider or a physical piece of hardware.
