== NAME
run - shell wrapper that splits iostreams into dvtm windows or tmux panes

== SYNOPSIS
run cmd [cmd-args]

without arguments, this page is displayed.  If any arguments are given,
they are passed verbatim to exec to create the 'runner' process.

== DESCRIPTION
run is a thin wrapper that spawns two new windows (either tmux panes
or dvtm windows) for each of the stdio streams, prepending timestamps.
The streams are also written intermixed to a log file, with a prefix
on lines from the error stream.

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=== RUN_OUTPUT_FMT
Data written by the runner is stored in the file
specified by RUN_OUTPUT_FMT.  Occurrences of %p in the format are
replaced by the pid of the caller (this way, if you execute multiple
runners from the same shell, they will all be in the same file.)
If not given, the default is '$HOME/.run-output/result-%p'.  Note
that there is no way to get the literal string "%p" into the output path.

=== DVTM_CMD_FIFO
If DVTM_CMD_FIFO is set, alternate windows will be created
by writing dvtm commands to this fifo.


=== TMUX
If TMUX is set and DVTM_CMD_FIFO is not, alternate panes will be
created by invoking "tmux split-window -p 50 -dI"
