A simple list of simple best practices.

*) Fail loudly (but tersely), succeed quietly.
   -) When an error occurs, a process should write a simple, concise, accurate error
      message to stderr and terminate.  Error messages should *not* offer suggestions.  eg:
      "The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?"
      is just annoying.  A better error message would be simply:
      "localhost:8080: connection refused"
      The rest is line noise.  Perhaps include the name of the executable.  Maybe include the
      uid or human readable name of the process owner.
*) A usage statement is not an error message.
*) A stack trace is not an error message; it is an embarassment.
*) Write errors to stderr.  Write output to stdout.  Write logs somewhere else.
*) Don't use logs as metrics.
*) Version everything!  Do not hardcode version numbers in a file; derive them from a VCS.
*) Rigidly enforce commit message formats from the first commit.
*) Don't use '.sh' suffixes on shell scripts.
*) Never deploy the tip of a branch; deploy a specific commit

Slogans:
Plan for failure, automate, test extensively.
