Note that gpg caches the passwords unless --no-symkey-cache is used.  Need
to understand the implications of that; where is the cache?  This seems
horribly insecure.


gpg --no-symkey-cache -c ${file} > ${file}.gpg  # encrypt w/symmetric key
gpg -d ${file}.gpg                              # decrypt w/symmetric key
gpg --generate-key                              # create a signing key
