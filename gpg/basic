To encrypt a file with a password derived symmetric key:

$ gpg --no-symkey-cache -c ${file} > ${file}.gpg

To decrypt with symmetric key:

$ gpg -d ${file}.gpg


Note that gpg caches the passwords unless --no-symkey-cache is used.  Need
to understand the implications of that; where is the cache?  This seems
horribly insecure.


gpg --generate-key #  create a key for use with git
