Notes/thoughts on my new laptop.

*)	Why did I not just get Debian?  I hate pacman!
*)	neither gcc nor vi came installed.  I thought vi was mandated by standards?
*)	The wired connection does not seem to work, and tethering on my phone is painful.
	Updating packages with pacman is hard on the slow wifi, and it is essential to
	use --disable-download-timeout.   That should absolutely be the default, and it
	is clear that whoever designed this was not thinking about people with lousy
	connections.  Bottom line; first command that needs to be run is:

	sudo pacman -Syy --disable-downloat-timeout

	This updates the pacman db.  Without doing that, attempts to install/upgrade
	packages will mostly fail.  After that, we can start installing packages.

*)	Here's the order in which I installed things:
	*) created a pgp key and a new rsa key, added to github
	*) cloned my dotfiles from github (weird that git is installed out of the box, but not gcc nor vim!)
	*) installed gcc: sudo pacman -S gcc
