GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES: colon separated list of directories that will not be checked when looking up tree for gitdir
I generally add $HOME to GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES so I can put things like .bash-local in git.  If you want files
is a subdir of $HOME to be tracked, you just need to use $HOME as your workdir.
