# Moving a worktree
#
# There is no 'git worktree move' command (as of 2.42.0)
# If you have worktree at /p/a/t/h/old-work that
# is a worktree of /path/repo and you move it to
# /new/path/old-work, then you should modify
# /path/repo/.git/worktrees/old-work/gitdir
#
# If you move the worktree to /p/a/t/new-work
# then it may be sufficient to mv
# /path/repo/.git/worktrees/old-work to
# /path/repo/.git/worktrees/new-work and modify
# the gitdir, but I haven't tested that.
