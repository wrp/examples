To attach a note to an object:
	git notes add -m "This is a note" $oid

Notes which are shown in a log are determined by core.notesRef and notes.displayRef.

To push:
	git push ${remote?} refs/notes/*

To fetch
	git fetch  ${remote?} refs/notes/commits:refs/notes/commits

notes are neither pushed nor fetched by default.
Add the following line to the config for the remote:
	fetch = +refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*
