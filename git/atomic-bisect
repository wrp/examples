# A method to bisect over merge commits.  Essentially, treat
# all commits of a branch atomically. (Untested)

# Start your bisect normally
git bisect start $bad $good

# Skip every non-merge reachable from $bad but not from $good
git bisect skip $(git rev-list --no-merges $good..$bad)

# â€¦then proceed (manually mark good/bad at each step, or use `git bisect run`)
