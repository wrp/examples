To setup push to go to multiple remotes, add stanzas like:


[remote "all"]
	pushurl = ssh://git@codeberg.org/user/repo
	pushurl = ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
	fetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/codeberg/main
[remote "github"]
	url = git@github.com:user/repo
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*
[remote "codeberg"]
	url = ssh://git@codeberg.org/user/repo
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/codeberg/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = all
	merge = refs/heads/main

Unfortunately, with the above setup, a 'git push' from main
will update both remotes, but it will only fetch from one
of them, so you need to explicitly 'git fetch' the other
to update the local refs.
