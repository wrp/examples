# By default, git-diff shows the difference between the working tree and the index.

git diff        # Show differences between working tree and index
git diff HEAD   # Show differences between working tree and latest commit

# Show the files changed from branch to main
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base ${branch} ${main-main})..${branch}


git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A  # Show only added files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=a  # Exclude added files


# Ignore files in which the only change is addition or removal of empty lines.
# This will show changed lines with only whitespace, but . does not match
# newline, so purely empty lines will not be detected and the file
# will be omitted from consideration.
