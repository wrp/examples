basic workflow:
Make changes and do not commit in git.

$ arc diff   # create a new commit in phabricator

pull/rebase/make changes, whatever

# Show extant diffs (a "diff" is a commit in differential,
# phabricator's web UI (or whatever))
$ arc list

$ arc amend --revision ${rev}  # rev is provided by 'arc list'
